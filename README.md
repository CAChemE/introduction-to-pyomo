# introduction-to-pyomo


Learn how to use Pyomo, an open source free alternative to GAMS and AMPL developed in Python, to solve engineering optimization problems with application both academically and industrially.


Pyomo allows to solve a wide range of optimization problems (LP, QP, NP, MILP, MINLP, MISP, etc.), and is able to communicate with the main commercial, free and / or free optimization solvers.


The methods of solving these types of problems, especially when there are discrete variables, are not widespread, despite their enormous potential. Therefore, in this workshop, a brief review of the basic concepts of optimization will be done.


Likewise, there will be a small introduction to the Python language, specially designed for students with a background in other types of high-level languages ​​focused on mathematical calculation, such as MATLAB. The workshop is aimed at students with basic programming knowledge.
